This starter allows you to easily create a website to showcase your work. It also makes it easy to keep it up to date thanks to Strapi.

It relies on several Strapi features:

* Collection types for projects and categories
* Single types for the homepage, the about page and the global config
* Components for reusable UI components and SEO metadata
* Dynamic zones to have full control over your content

On the frontend, we're using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), a Vue.js framework for static sites. It uses GraphQL to query data and Tailwind CSS for styles.

## Getting started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/strapi/strapi-starter-gridsome-portfolio.git
cd strapi-starter-gridsome-portfolio
```

### Backend

Make sure you're in the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies and run your server:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn install
yarn develop

# Using npm
npm install
npm run develop
```

The first time you start your project, sample seed data will be imported.

### Frontend

Make sure you're in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies and start the Gridsome server:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn install
yarn develop

# Using npm
npm install
npm run develop
```

The Gridsome server will run here => [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Deploying to production

You will need to deploy the `frontend` and `backend` projects separately. Here are the docs to deploy each one:

* [Deploy Strapi](https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/admin-panel/deploy.html#deployment)
* [Deploy Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/docs/deployment/)

Don't forget to set up your environment variables on your production apps.

Have fun using this starter!
